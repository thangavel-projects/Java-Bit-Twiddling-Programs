Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word. A bitwise operation operates on one or more bit patterns or binary numerals at the level of their individual bits. It is a fast, primitive action directly supported by the central processing unit (CPU),
and is used to manipulate values for comparisons and calculations.
